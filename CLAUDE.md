# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Running the App

**Local (uvicorn):**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

**Docker (preferred for full stack):**
```bash
docker compose up -d --build          # start all services
docker compose logs -f app            # tail app logs
docker compose logs -f worker         # tail worker logs
docker compose down                   # stop everything
```

Verify with: `curl http://localhost:8000/healthz` → `{"status": "ok"}`

No test suite or linting config exists for this repo itself (the orchestrator). Tests run against the *target* sandbox repo (`suyog19/sandbox-fastapi-app`) as part of `story_implementation`.

## Environment Variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in secrets. All values are required unless noted.

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | PostgreSQL DSN — default: `postgresql://orchestrator:orchestrator@db:5432/orchestrator` |
| `REDIS_URL` | Redis DSN — default: `redis://redis:6379/0` |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Claude API key (`claude-sonnet-4-6` is the model used) |
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | PAT with repo write, PR create/merge, label permissions |
| `JIRA_HOST` | Jira instance URL (e.g. `https://yourorg.atlassian.net`) |
| `JIRA_USERNAME` | Jira API user (email) |
| `JIRA_API_TOKEN` | Jira API token |
| `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` | Bot token from @BotFather |
| `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` | Chat ID for notifications |
| `MAX_WORKERS` | Worker thread concurrency (default: `2`) |
| `ENV_NAME` | `DEV` or `PROD` — prepended to all Telegram messages |
| `PUBLIC_BASE_URL` | Public URL of this service (used when registering Telegram webhook) |
| `JIRA_CUSTOM_FIELD_EPIC_LINK` | Jira epic link custom field ID (default: `customfield_10014`) |

## Architecture

Python/FastAPI orchestration service. Receives Jira webhook events, persists them in PostgreSQL, dispatches workflows via a Redis-backed queue, executes them in a background worker, and notifies via Telegram.

**Key files:**
- `app/main.py` — FastAPI app, all HTTP endpoints
- `app/worker.py` — queue consumer; runs workflows in threads (MAX_WORKERS=2); recovers stale RUNNING→FAILED on startup
- `app/workflows.py` — `story_implementation` and `epic_breakdown` workflow logic
- `app/claude_client.py` — all Claude API calls (summarize, suggest, fix, plan); uses `claude-sonnet-4-6` with ephemeral prompt caching on system prompts
- `app/database.py` — all DB access; schema migrations in `init_db()`
- `app/feedback.py` — feedback/memory constants and failure categorisation functions
- `app/dispatcher.py` — reads workflow_events and enqueues jobs onto Redis
- `app/file_modifier.py` — applies code patches returned by Claude (original → replacement matching)
- `app/repo_analysis.py` — introspects cloned repos (language detection, entry points, file counts) before Claude calls
- `app/webhooks.py` — Jira and Telegram webhook receivers
- `app/jira_client.py` — Jira REST API v3 calls
- `app/github_api.py` — GitHub API calls (PR creation, labels, merge)
- `app/git_ops.py` — clone, commit, push
- `app/repo_mapping.py` — CRUD for `repo_mappings` table
- `app/test_runner.py` — runs `pytest -q` in a cloned workspace
- `app/queue.py` — Redis queue enqueue/dequeue

**Event flow:**
```
Jira Webhook → POST /webhooks/jira → workflow_events → Dispatcher
  → Redis Queue → Worker thread

  story_implementation:
    clone repo → analyze → summarize → suggest change (+ memory) → apply
    → run tests → [fix attempt if failed] → commit/push → PR → auto-merge

  epic_breakdown:
    fetch planning memory → Claude decompose (+ memory) → store proposals
    → Telegram approval gate (APPROVE / REJECT / REGENERATE)
    → create Stories in Jira → trigger story_implementation via status change

Telegram Webhook → POST /webhooks/telegram → APPROVE/REJECT/REGENERATE handler
```

**Workflow triggers:**
| Jira status | Issue type | Workflow |
|---|---|---|
| `Ready for Dev` (case-insensitive) | Story | `story_implementation` |
| `Ready for Breakdown` (case-insensitive) | Epic | `epic_breakdown` |

## Data Model

All tables are created (and migrated) by `init_db()` in `app/database.py`. First startup also seeds `repo_mappings` from `config/seed_mappings.json`.

| Table | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `workflow_events` | Raw Jira/Telegram webhook payloads |
| `workflow_runs` | One row per workflow execution; tracks status, branch, PR, test/merge/review results |
| `workflow_attempts` | Per-attempt records within a run (implement + optional fix) |
| `repo_mappings` | Jira project key → repo slug + branch + auto-merge policy |
| `planning_outputs` | Proposed Stories from epic_breakdown; one row per item per run |
| `feedback_events` | Atomic signals written after each run completes (append-only) |
| `memory_snapshots` | Derived and human-authored guidance; one row per (scope_type, scope_key, memory_kind) |
| `agent_reviews` | One row per Reviewer Agent verdict; FK to `workflow_runs` |

**`workflow_runs` status flow:**
```
RECEIVED → QUEUED → RUNNING → COMPLETED
                            → FAILED
                            → WAITING_FOR_APPROVAL → COMPLETED (after APPROVE)
                                                    → FAILED    (after REJECT/REGENERATE)
```

**`memory_snapshots` kinds:** `planning_guidance`, `execution_guidance`, `manual_note`
**`memory_snapshots` scopes:** `repo` (scope_key = repo_slug), `epic` (scope_key = epic_key)

## Telegram Message Format

```
[DEV|PROD]
[Orchestrator]
Event: <type>
Status: <status>
Details: <short summary>
```

Approval commands for epic_breakdown are sent as plain text to the bot: `APPROVE <run_id>`, `REJECT <run_id>`, `REGENERATE <run_id>`.

## Environment Model

Two separate VMs. Never share a VM between dev and prod.

| Environment | VM IP | Branch | Runner label | Domain |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Dev | `65.2.140.4` | `dev` | `self-hosted-dev` | `dev.orchestrator.suyogjoshi.com` |
| Prod | `13.234.33.241` | `main` | `self-hosted-prod` | `orchestrator.suyogjoshi.com` |

## Two-File `.env` Rule — CRITICAL

There are two `.env` files on each VM. They serve different purposes and must both be kept in sync.

**`/home/ubuntu/.env.orchestrator`** — persistent secrets file on the VM. This is the source of truth. It survives deploys and is never overwritten by GitHub Actions.

**`<project_dir>/.env`** — the file Docker containers actually read via `env_file:` in `docker-compose.yml`. This is overwritten on every deploy by the step: `cp /home/ubuntu/.env.orchestrator .env`.

### Rules

1. To update a secret permanently: edit `/home/ubuntu/.env.orchestrator`, then redeploy (push to branch or run manually).
2. If you update `.env.orchestrator` manually mid-iteration and need containers to pick it up immediately — do NOT just run `docker compose up -d`. You must run:

```bash
cp /home/ubuntu/.env.orchestrator .env
docker compose up -d --force-recreate
```

3. `docker compose up -d` without `--force-recreate` does NOT reload environment variables into already-running containers.
4. Always verify the key landed in the container after a change:

```bash
docker exec <container-name> env | grep <VAR_NAME>
```

## Working Style

Implement one iteration at a time. After each: confirm it runs, provide test steps, wait for user confirmation before moving to the next step.

When a decision affects architecture, multiple valid approaches exist, credentials are needed, or external services require setup — ask before proceeding, using this format:

```
QUESTION: <clear question>
OPTIONS:
1. Option A
2. Option B
RECOMMENDATION: <recommendation + why>
```

## Deferred / Out of Scope

- Feature-level Jira hierarchy (locked: Epic → Story only, no Feature or Task levels)
- No code path should reference or route to a `feature_breakdown` workflow
- Global-scope memory (deferred — no cross-repo patterns exist yet)
- Run-scope memory injection (single-run signals not worth feeding back into the same run)
- Memory pruning / decay (snapshots are recomputed from raw events — no TTL needed)
- Semantic/vector search for memory retrieval (rule-based aggregation is sufficient)
- UI or dashboard
- Production security hardening
- Multi-agent planning
